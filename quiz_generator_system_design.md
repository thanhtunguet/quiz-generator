# AI-Powered Quiz Generator System Design

## Implementation approach

For this AI-powered quiz generator web application, we'll implement a clean, modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

1. **Frontend**: React with Tailwind CSS for a responsive, modern UI
   - Component-based architecture for maintainability
   - State management using React hooks
   - Tailwind CSS for styling without custom CSS
   - File upload components for document handling
   - Quiz display with interactive elements

2. **Backend**: NestJS with TypeScript
   - RESTful API endpoints
   - Modular service architecture
   - Document processing pipeline
   - Integration with AI services
   
3. **Document Processing**:
   - PDF: pdf-parse library
   - DOCX: mammoth.js library
   - PPTX: pptx-parser library

4. **AI Integration**:
   - Primary: OpenAI API
   - Strategy pattern for future LLM provider options

5. **Data Flow**:
   - Client uploads documents
   - Server extracts text
   - Text sent to AI for quiz generation
   - Structured quiz returned to frontend
   - Options for user to view, interact with, and download quiz

### Difficult Points and Solutions

1. **Document Parsing Challenges**:
   - Various document formats with different structures
   - **Solution**: Use specialized libraries for each format with a unified interface

2. **AI Response Formatting**:
   - Ensuring consistent structure from LLM outputs
   - **Solution**: Implement robust validation and parsing of AI responses

3. **Large Document Handling**:
   - Memory constraints with large documents
   - **Solution**: Implement chunking for large documents

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Multiple failure points (upload, parsing, AI)  
   - **Solution**: Comprehensive error handling with helpful user feedback

## Data structures and interfaces

The system will use the following key data structures and interfaces:

### Frontend Components

- **Document Upload**: Handles file selection and upload
- **Text Preview**: Displays and allows editing of extracted text
- **Quiz Generator**: Interfaces with backend API
- **Quiz Display**: Renders questions and answers
- **Quiz Export**: Handles download functionality

### Backend Services

- **Upload Service**: Handles file reception and storage
- **Document Parser**: Extracts text from various file formats
- **Quiz Service**: Interfaces with AI provider
- **Response Formatter**: Structures AI responses

### Data Models

Please see the class diagram for detailed data structures and interfaces.

## Anything UNCLEAR

1. **Authentication Requirements**: The optional stretch goal mentions authentication, but specific requirements (roles, permissions, etc.) aren't detailed. For MVP, we'll implement basic authentication if needed.

2. **Quiz Complexity Customization**: It's not specified if users should be able to customize quiz parameters (number of questions, difficulty). We'll provide a basic implementation with default parameters.

3. **Error Handling Requirements**: Specific requirements for error handling and recovery aren't provided. We'll implement standard error handling and logging.

4. **Performance Requirements**: No specific performance benchmarks are mentioned. We'll optimize for reasonable performance under normal usage conditions.

5. **Deployment Environment**: The deployment environment isn't specified. We'll design for containerization and cloud deployment flexibility.
